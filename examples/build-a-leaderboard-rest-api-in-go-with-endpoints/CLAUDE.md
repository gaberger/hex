## Behavioral Rules

- ALWAYS read a file before editing it
- NEVER commit secrets, credentials, or .env files
- ALWAYS run tests after making code changes

## Hexagonal Architecture Rules (ENFORCED)

These rules are checked by `hex analyze .`:

1. **domain/** must only import from **domain/**
2. **ports/** may import from **domain/** but nothing else
3. **usecases/** may import from **domain/** and **ports/** only
4. **adapters/primary/** may import from **ports/** only
5. **adapters/secondary/** may import from **ports/** only
6. **adapters must NEVER import other adapters** (cross-adapter coupling)
7. **composition-root** is the ONLY file that imports from adapters
8. All relative imports MUST use `.js` extensions (NodeNext module resolution)

## File Organization

```
src/
  core/
    domain/          # Pure business logic, zero external deps
    ports/           # Typed interfaces (contracts between layers)
    usecases/        # Application logic composing ports
  adapters/
    primary/         # Driving adapters (CLI, HTTP, browser input)
    secondary/       # Driven adapters (DB, API, filesystem)
  composition-root   # Wires adapters to ports (single DI point)
```

## Security

- Never commit `.env` files — use `.env.example`
- Primary adapters MUST NOT use `innerHTML`/`outerHTML`/`insertAdjacentHTML` with any data that originates outside the domain layer. Use `textContent` or DOM APIs (`createElement`) instead.
